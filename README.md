## Installation

### Pre-requisites
- In order to build you should have node and npm installed.
- Gulp should be globally installed

### Build
run these commands to build.
- npm i
- gulp
go to build directory and open index.html file

### Further Improvements:

- Current Program have single level.
- We can create other levels by changing min score variable(minScore), total time variable(count) and number of distinct colors variable (distColors = 4 or 8) in main.js
If above doesn't work please let me know, I will send the build directory or host somewhere.
